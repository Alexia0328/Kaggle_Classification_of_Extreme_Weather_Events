# Kaggle_Classification_of_Extreme_Weather_Events

This project is about detection of extreme weather events from atmospherical data. The dataset used is from ClimateNet and contains 19 features, 16 of which are atmospheric variables, as well as latitude, longitude and time. There are three labels for the classification, Standard background conditions, Tropical cyclone and Atmospheric river.

In this kaggle, logistic regression had to be used. In addition, SVM, Naive Bayes and Random Forests were used for additional attempts. From the results, the logistic regression model is about 0.73. Among the other three models, random forest has the best result of about 0.765.
